## Core Architecture and Resource management Conceots

* An organization in Microsoft Azure would need its Azure administrators to properly set up the core structure of the organization in resource management.
* This is the first and top structure that is required before you can add cloud resources to the cloud platform.
* An organization with different departments with members in different roles would find this beneficial

* There are **four levels** for organizing your organization’s resources in **Microsoft Azure**.

## Azure Management Groups

* Azure Management Groups is the top level of the core structure of managing your cloud resources in Azure
* It is useful in organizing and structuring your resources in Microsoft Azure. The management groups are where Azure administrators manage everything about user access, compliance, and policies for subscriptions.
* Azure Role-based Access Control (RBAC) for all resources and role definitions is supported in the management groups.

**Azure Subscrptions**

* Subscriptions in Azure are like a big container for all accounts of users and what resources they have accessed or used within the subscription.
* Every subscription usually has a limit on the amount of resources a certain user can create and use.
* As an organization, you can use subscriptions to control the monthly bill and resources costs in your organization or your own Azure account.

**Azure Resource Groups**
* Azure users can group their services or resources using Azure Resource Groups.
* A resource group in Microsoft Azure acts as a logical container where resources like servers, web applications, databases, storage, monitoring, etc. are deployed, managed, and stored
* The Availability Set is the logical group for Virtual Machines (VMs).

**Azure Resources**
* The databases, servers, virtual machines or web applications you create on Azure platform are considered Azure resources.

**Azure Resource Manager**

* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is also an important element in managing resources in Azure. ARM is the management and deployment service that provides users the capability to add, edit and delete resources in Azure
* By using ARM, the organization can manage user access control and organize resources securely even after deployment.
* Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) are commonly used to automate deployments and to implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Azure provides native support for IaC using the ARM templates and also Azure Bicep in Azure Resource Manager.

Terraform is also supported on Azure. IaC creates a great advantage, and it enables good deployment automation of the infrastructure in the cloud. Using Infrastructure as Code, you can automate your deployment by generating templates for the same environment every time. Infrastructure as Code process minimizes the problems of environment drift during development releases.

Azure provides third-party support for other automated IaC platforms like Terraform, Red Hat Ansible, Chef Automate, and Pulumi.
