# CLOUD COMPUTING

## Outcomes
* Analyze the different cloud models to design the best solution to support business requirements.
* Manage and maintain servers, including OS configurations, access control and virtualization.
* Analyze system requirements to successfully execute workload migrations to the cloud.
* Maintain and optimize cloud environments, including proper automation and orchestration procedures, backup and restore operations, and disaster recovery tasks.
* Troubleshoot capacity, automation, connectivity and security issues related to cloud implementations

## Module 1: CLOUD COMPUTING FUNDAMENTALS
*  The cloud is changing how organizations are planning to deliver services to their customers, suppliers, and partners. They're using cloud services to increase the pace of business and to offer new and innovative services.

### What is the cloud?
* the impact of cloud has revolutionized the way organizations operate ,offering essential features like on-demand access to computing **power and storage** ,virtually unlimited scalability and flexible pricing models.
* Adoption of cloud technologies is focused primarile on cost reduction and shifting technology expenditures from  capital to operational expenses.
* As a result, most organizations have embraced a pragmatic hybrid cloud strategy, utilizing a combination of public and private cloud services based on their specific business needs
* They retain critical applications within their data centers while leveraging innovative Software as a Service (SaaS) applications and cloud infrastructure services.

## 5 CHARACTERISTICS Defined by NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST):

**On-Demand Self-Service**
* Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically.Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly.These resources might include additional computer power ,additional storage,new websites or even database services

**Broad Network Access**
* client devices and traditionalmserver deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network.
* Network might include the local on premises network or the internet or it might include both.
* Cloud resources have the potential to be globally accessible

**Resource Pooling**
* The cloud service provider(CSP) pools resources in a multitenant mmodel and adjust resource allocation on an on demand basis.the specific distribution of hardware resources id abstracted from the consumer.
* CSPs pool network,storage and compute capabilities and then dynamically and automatically allocate those resources might physically be located.
* So in most cases the next time those services are used  by consumers the resources locations might have changed.
* CSP manages the resources and maximizes their use.

**Rapid Elasticity**
* Resources are provisioned and released to adjust for change in demandand consumption, in this case the process may be automatic or manual.
* Server resources in a traditional model are purchased as a capital expenditure and whether or not those resources are efficiently utilized,their cost and their capabililites are fixed.
* With cloud-based computing ,resources are dynamically allocated ,making for far more efficient utlization of those resources.
* So servers that might have been underutlized for most of the year no longer need to be purchased and maintained.

**Measured Service**
* Metering of resources is monitored ,controlled and billable.CSPs meter the utlization of their resources .
* Having metering permits more efficient and dyanmic resource allocation.
* it also permits the CSPs to bill consumers accurately for exaclty the quantity of resources consumed

## Cloud Computing Ecosystems
the ecosystem consists of three categories of players

### Consumers of Services
   - These are everyday end users like myself that use cloud services in their day-to-day business activities
    **Examples**
     * **Microsoft OneDrive**: OneDrive is a file hosting and synchronization services that is offered by Microsoft,it enables users to store and share files and access them from any device,this includes PCs ,Macs and mobile devices
     * **Google Drive**: Google Drive is a cloud storage and file backup provider offered by google,it offers free storage for personal use and allows users to store files,collaborate on documents and share files witth others.
     * **Icloud**: Icloud is a cloud storage and synchronization that is provided by Apple.It allows users  to store their photos,videos ,documents and other files that one can access from all Apple devices.
  
### Provider of Services

These cloud providers offer a variety of functions ranging from infrastructure services to different applications and tools
**Examples of Prominent Providers**

* **Amazon Web Servies (AWS)**: it is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.It offers a wide array of services,including **computing power**,**storage** ,**databases**,**networking**,**analytics**,**machine learning**.
*  **Microsoft Azure**: is a cloud computing platform that is offered by Microsofyt ,it provides a range of services for building ,deploying and managing applications and services through Microsofy managed data centers
